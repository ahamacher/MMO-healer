## MMO Healer
### Background and Overview

  I play healers in MMOâ€™s, it is a brutal thankless position. I would like to impart some of my experiences into a healing minigame. 

  MMO Healer is a raid healing minigame. The goal is to complete the encounter while your party does everything it can to try and fail. Select skills to use and which keys to bind them to, then use skills to keep your party alive. Each stage consists of a boss, who will perform different moves on different targets. sometimes these targets are chosen, sometimes random. 

The game consists of multiple levels each with their own mechanics and specific spell requirements.

### Functionality and MVP Features
* script to simulate fights
  * bosses need to have skill use text
  * raid members need to have health bars, debuff icons
  * bosses to have some scripted and some random interactions
    * example: a boss chooses from a list of 3 different moves normally but if the boss hits a certain % of life left they will change up their moves and cast specific skills.
* different spells
  * Spells need to have both a cast time and a mana cost
  * Spells chosen from a list of potential spells
* keyboard bindings
  * assign spells to keybindings
  * lets a player use buttons familiar to them
* multiple levels
  * different encounters, each bringing unique challenges.
